## ‚ú® Project Highlights

- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Mapping**: Responsive web application built with Leaflet.js
- üìä **Data Engineering**: Custom ETL pipeline processing municipal open data
- üóÉÔ∏è **Database Design**: Normalized PostgreSQL schema with PostGIS spatial capabilities
- üì± **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface with bottom sheet navigation
- üì∏ **Instagram Integration**: Seamless connection with [@yvrwaterfountains](https://www.instagram.com/yvrwaterfountains/) reviews
- üõ°Ô∏è **Moderation System**: Professional review management for public submissions
- üîß **DevOps**: Automated deployment pipeline with GitHub Pages

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with Leaflet.js for mapping
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive CSS with modern UI patterns
- **UX**: Conditional popups (desktop) vs bottom sheets (mobile)
- **Script organization**: Map behavior now lives in [`docs/js/map.js`](docs/js/map.js) so the HTML remains simple and the logic is easy to review.

### Backend & Data Pipeline
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostGIS) for spatial data
- **ETL Process**: Python pipeline transforming UTM coordinates to WGS84
- **Data Sources**: Vancouver and Burnaby municipal open data portals
- **Instagram API**: Automated post ID extraction and metadata collection
- **Review System**: Multi-criteria rating system with moderation workflows
- **Validation**: Automated coordinate bounds checking and duplicate detection

### Key Technical Challenges Solved
1. **Coordinate Transformation**: Converted UTM Zone 10N municipal data to web-standard WGS84
2. **Data Normalization**: Unified disparate CSV formats into consistent schema
3. **Instagram Integration**: Seamless workflow for [@yvrwaterfountains](https://www.instagram.com/yvrwaterfountains/) review management
4. **Review Moderation**: Built comprehensive approval/rejection system for public submissions
5. **Multi-Review Architecture**: Support for multiple reviews per fountain with rating aggregation
6. **Spatial Optimization**: Implemented efficient rendering of 429+ map markers
7. **Mobile Performance**: Custom bottom sheet UI with Instagram post previews

## üß≠ Editing the Map Code

- The map logic now lives in [`docs/js/map.js`](docs/js/map.js), which keeps the HTML file light and makes maintenance easier.
- The script uses plain JavaScript with lots of inline explanations, so you can scroll from top to bottom and follow what each helper does.
- Functions that need to be callable from the HTML (for example the links inside popups) are attached to `window` so they stay available without extra setup.
- Error handling is centralized, so if the GeoJSON file fails to load you will see one clear alert instead of partial failures.

### How to Test Changes Manually

1. Open `docs/map.html` in a browser (double-clicking the file works) and make sure the map pins load.
2. Click a fountain marker on desktop to confirm the popup still shows ratings, Instagram previews, and review text.
3. Shrink the browser window below 768px and click a pin to confirm the bottom sheet opens and can be dismissed.
4. Use the "My Location" button to check geolocation permissions, and try the admin gear icon to make sure the password prompt still appears.

## üìä Project Impact & Results

### Data Successfully Processed
- **429 Public Fountains** mapped across two municipalities
- **Coordinate Accuracy**: All locations validated within Vancouver/Burnaby boundaries
- **Data Integration**: Unified disparate municipal datasets into single schema
- **Performance**: 95% file size reduction through optimization techniques

### User Experience Achievements
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Touch-friendly controls and clear visual hierarchy
- **Load Performance**: < 3 second initial load time with 429 map markers
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for older browsers

## üîß Development Methodology

### Problem-Solving Approach
1. **Data Quality Issues**: Implemented validation pipeline catching coordinate anomalies
2. **Performance Optimization**: Built file compression reducing payload by 95%
3. **User Interface Design**: Created adaptive UI (popups vs bottom sheets) based on device capabilities
4. **Deployment Automation**: Established CI/CD workflow with GitHub Pages

### Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Spatial Data Processing**: UTM to WGS84 coordinate transformation
- **Database Design**: Normalized schema with proper relationships and constraints
- **API Development**: RESTful data endpoints with Supabase
